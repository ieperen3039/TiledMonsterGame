# FreightGame
A railroad tycoon game about mangement and planning.

The player starts on a world that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike our own world. The main difference is the lack of transportation methods. Situated at the start of the railroad era, the player starts a monopoly on railroad transportation with limited funds. The player builds stations, connects them with railroads and buys trains with the necessary wagons hooked on. Transporting goods from one industry to another gives the player revenue based on distance, time in transit and the base revenue values of the transported goods.

# The project
There is no timeframe for this project. Thanks to the modding system, each collaborator can work on a strictly defined part of the game, working on interfaces and allowing easy integration testing.

The unmodded game engine itself only consists of the bare minimum not to crash, and once finished, should see very few influental changes.

# Collaboration
Still has to be kicked off. Contact me.
