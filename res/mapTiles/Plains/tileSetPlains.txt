# Basic set of tiles.

# Each line must have the following structure:
# <mesh-filename> [hitbox-filename] [texture-filename] [properties...]
# Where properties is a summation of properties this tile has
# Any element not given must be replaced with a single dash '-', except for the properties field
# If no specific hitbox is required, use a dash. The plain set will be used instead
# The set of properties may change over time
# Empty lines or lines starting with # are ignored
